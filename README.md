# ✈️ AI-Powered Flight Reminder Tool

A complete flight delay prediction and reminder system built with Python and Streamlit. This AI-powered tool analyzes weather conditions, travel patterns, and various risk factors to provide smart reminders and delay predictions for your flights.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Delay Prediction**: Machine learning algorithms analyze multiple factors to predict flight delay probability
- **Real-time Weather Integration**: Uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather conditions
- **Smart Reminders**: Personalized recommendations based on weather, season, and travel patterns
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Identifies and explains various risk factors affecting your flight
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive Streamlit-based UI
- **Multiple City Support**: Covers major airports in India and internationally
- **Mock Data Support**: Works without API keys using realistic mock data

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-flight-reminder.git
   cd ai-flight-reminder
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Optional: OpenWeatherMap API Key

For real-time weather data, get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api):

1. Sign up for a free account
2. Generate an API key
3. Enter the key in the application's sidebar

**Note**: The application works perfectly without an API key using mock data for demonstration purposes.

## 📱 How to Use

1. **Select Departure City**: Choose your departure city from the dropdown
2. **Pick Travel Date**: Select your travel date (up to 30 days in advance)
3. **Enter API Key** (optional): Add your OpenWeatherMap API key for real-time data
4. **Analyze Flight**: Click the "Analyze Flight" button
5. **View Results**: Get delay probability, weather forecast, risk factors, and smart reminders

## 🧠 AI Features

### Delay Prediction Algorithm

The AI system considers multiple factors:

- **Weather Conditions**: Rain, thunderstorms, snow, fog, temperature extremes
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Monsoon, winter, summer, and holiday seasons
- **Travel Patterns**: Weekend vs weekday travel, holiday periods
- **Environmental Factors**: Wind speed, humidity, visibility

### Smart Reminders

The system generates personalized reminders based on:

- Delay risk level (Low/Moderate/High)
- Weather-specific advice
- City-specific tips
- Travel timing recommendations
